			<h2> Chocolate Hills, Philippines</h2>
			<p class="M">Meet the only place on earth with thousands of unusually symmetrical hills. This unique landscape has many folktales explaining its creation, one of the most common being the story of two quarrelling giants throwing boulders, mud, and sand at each other. However, there were some farmers carrying cocoa beans who got caught in the fight, so they ran, dropping some cocoa into the soil. Once the people returned, they were surprised to see over a thousand chocolate-coloured hills that had grown from the battlefield.</p>

				<p class="G">The island that the Chocolate Hills reside on rose from the sea sometime between 3 to 5 million years ago, from the late Pliocene to the early Pleistocene era. Millenia of erosion from rain, surface and groundwater, and streams after their rise are what created these hills. They are geomorphological features called cockpit karst; no other country with cockpit karsts has the unusual symmetries the Chocolate Hills have.</p>

The lake in Kawah Ijen is the largest acidic lake in the world, with an acidity comparable to that of a car battery acid (0.5 pH). The volcano here is one of the only two volcanoes in the world with lava and flames that appear in an electric-blue colour due to the high quantities of sulfur combustion. </p>

				<p class="G">The volcanic activity began about 300,000 years ago in a place now called &ldquo;Old Ijen.&rdquo; With repeated eruptions, lava and pyroclastic deposits lie over the Miocene limestone, raising to heights up to 3 kilometres. About 250,000 years later, a series of enormous explosive eruptions formed a caldera roughly 16 kilometres in diameter.</p>

				<p class="G">Socotra was situated in the cetre of the supercontinent Gondwana, near what is now Africa, Arabia, India, and Madagascar. As Arabia split from the African continental plate 15 to 20 million years ago, Socotra remained on the same continental plate as Africa, leaving it as a fragment of the continent. Socotra was then pushed further away by the Red Sea axis and the East African Rift Valley system.</p>

				<p class="G">The creation of Zhangjiajie began about 1.5 billion years ago. In northwest Hunan, the land was transformed into a sea trough by solid motions in the Earth's crust and the eruption of an underwater volcano. The &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; of Zhangjiajie&#39;s sandstone peak forest were formed from the quartz in the lava. Northwestern Hunan then experienced sea erosion 380 million years ago. The shallow sea of Wulingyuan in Zhangjiajie at the time received large amounts of soil and loose clastic rocks. These then developed into a sandstone peak forest with over 3,000 pillars with knife-edged faces.
